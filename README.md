## üí°Inspiration
In a time of an emergency when a patient is unconscious, how can we be so sure that the first aid responders know what painkillers they can give, what condition they might've fallen ill to, and what their medical history is? Many years ago, there was an incident where a patient was allergic to the narcotics that were given to them. We want to change that and create a new standard when it comes to a new place for health records.

Patients are also more entitled to more privacy as blockchain is more secure and safe as possible. With new and more secure technologies, people can use blockchain to be confident that their information is immutable and protected with encryption and a private key that only their wearable/device has.

We give healthcare professionals access to data for their personal healthcare information ONLY when the patient has fallen ill.

## üîçWhat it does
Emergenchain provides three primary uses. Firstly, we offer a secure and organized way to store one's medical records. This provides a convenient way for doctors to access a patient's medical history. Additionally, we also offer a certificate for vaccines and immunizations. This way people have an easy way to access their proof of vaccination for pandemics and other necessary immunizations. Furthermore, we offer an emergency summary sheet compiled from the information on their patient's medical history. This includes known health conditions and their risk. Finally, we have a QR code that displays the emergency information tab when scanned. This acts as a precaution for when someone is found unconscious, as first aid responders/medics can scan their QR code and immediately find details about the patient's health conditions, history, emergency contact information, and treatment methods.

## ‚öôÔ∏èHow we built it
We designed our front end using Figma and coded it on React. For our navbar, we used react-router-dom, and for styling, we used Tailwind CSS to decorate our elements and used framer motion to add animation. All of the medical records are stored DeSo blockchain as posts, and all of our certificates are NFTs minted with DeSo. We also used DeSo login, to implement our login. We minted NFTs on Georli testnet and can be seen using the contract https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x7D157EFe11FadC50ef28A509b6958F7320A6E6f9#writeContract all on DeSo.

## üößChallenges we ran into
Throughout Hack the Valley, we ran into various challenges. Our biggest challenge is definitely that we did not have a programmer proficient with the back end in our team. This was a huge challenge, as we had to learn back-end programming from the basics. Additionally, this was our first time straying from liveshare, and using GitHub to its fullest. It was a challenge to learn to coordinate with each other through branches, pull requests, and code issues. Finally, we are proud to say that we have successfully coded a fully functional project in under 36 hours!

## ‚úîÔ∏èAccomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of surmounting the seemingly endless streams of obstacles. Specifically, learning the fundamentals of back-end programming, utilizing it in a real-world project, and learning how to integrate it with our front end. Furthermore, we are proud to have successfully coordinated our project with each other through Github, in a more organized fashion than liveshare, with properly documented source control. Finally, we are proud of ourselves for creating a fully functional program that tackles a severe issue our world faces, changing the world step by line!

## üìöWhat we learned
We learned many things about the fundamentals of back-end programming such as POST and GET requests, as well as interpreting and implementing algorithms through their documentation. Furthermore, we learned a lot about the DeSo Protocol library from posting records onto the blockchain, to minting NFTs, to implementing a Login system. Additionally, we learned many new features regarding Github. Specifically, how to collaborate with each other by utilizing many tools including branches, pull requests, merges, code reviews, and many more!

## üî≠What's next for Health Hub
We want to be the company that revolutionizes the world by storm and creates a new mass adoption through healthcare data. We believe that blockchain and crypto could be used to revolutionize the healthcare industry and not only create an actual handheld device but also partner with the government to have ambulances and first-aid responders check our chip or code if anyone falls unconscious to see if they have any healthcare data on them.
